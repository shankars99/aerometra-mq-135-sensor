  - Python script
  	-> during callibration (frequency and timings set by user) the python script is run to note the quality of air based on the resistance of the SnO2 filament in the MQ-135 sensor, as this data varies over the day. 
  	->the callibration is required as it sets a rough estimate that can be used to compare the quality of air at a given moment with respect to the initial readings
  	-> since different MQ-135(s) have different resistance readings as output due to the different readings of the potentiometer, displaying the quality as relative with a absolute reading of Co2 index for purity was chosen as it is most convenient
  	-> for more hardcore users that understand the workings, with some tinkering with the potentiometer readings, individual readings of Gases can be obtained, as was done to generate the graph [ attached in others ] 
  	
  - Arduino Sketch
  	-> The script contains the data ( header [ needs to be copy pasted from the python script as it is ], the display, the processing, and the run )
  	-> the Display is the LED display based on the absolute value of CO2 present in the air
  	-> the processing results with a relative change in the amount of gas present in the air which is used to obtain the absolute values of gases
  	-> the run contains the conversion of the resistance read into the SI unit of ( ohms )
